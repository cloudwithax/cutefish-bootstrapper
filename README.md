# cutefish-bootstrapper

A shell script for installing the Cutefish desktop environment on Arch.

# Requirements

**IMPORTANT!!!**

You must have a barebones Arch install to run this script. This means that you have no pre-existing desktop environments installed. The script has checks for this as well, so if you try to run this script with a desktop environment installed, it will **not work.**


# Install

The easiest way to run this script is by typing in the following command in the terminal.

```
curl -sSL https://t.ly/cutefish | bash
```

Otherwise, clone the git repo and run the script from the newly created folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/cloudwithax/cutefish-bootstrapper
cd cutefish-bootstrapper
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```
